## Installation

```
npm install --save react-redux-fetch
```

# Goal
The goal of this library is to minimize boilerplate code  of crud operations in react/redux applications.

# Motivation
Redux provides a clean interface for handling data across your application, but integrating with a web service can become a quite cumbersome, repetitive task. [React-refetch by Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch) provides a good alternative, but doesn't keep your fetched data in the application state, which makes it more difficult to debug and handle side effects (e.g. with redux-saga). This module is strongly inspired by react-refetch; it exposes a `connect()` decorator to keep your components stateless. This function lets you map props to URLs. React-redux-fetch takes these mappings and creates functions which dispatch actions and passes them as props to your component. The response is also passed as a prop to your component with additional pending, fulfilled and rejected flags, just like react-refetch.
